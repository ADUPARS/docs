        Using Composer

    <p class="lead">You're not a developer, you're a code jedi. You laugh at copy and paste! Why not try Composer and Redux. It will make your develop that much easier.</p>

    <h3 id="composer-wppagagist">WP Packagist</h3>
    <p class="text">The most stable of releases reside on WordPress.org. Only those releases that have been tested by the masses. For the ultimate in stability, use this configuration. </p>

        Global Arguments
    </h1>
    <p class="lead">Redux has various levels of arguments, one for each type of object. So it makes sense that there would be global arguments which trickle down to all aspects of your project.</p>
    <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
        <h4>Arguments affect all aspects of Redux</h4>

        <p>You'll need to spend some time famililiarizing yourself with the different argument types for each object. For an extensive listing of all global arguments visit our <a href="/basics/global_arguments">Global Arguments</a> page.</p>
    </div>

    <h3 id="opt_name">Select a Unique opt_name</h3>

    <p class="lead">Redux is built to allow multiple projects to use Redux at once. You must select a unique
        <code>opt_name</code> to avoid avoid collision with other projects. Make sure you choose something that's not too common. Oh, and no spaces.</p>

    <h3 id="create_redux_instance">Creating a Redux Instance</h3>
    <p class="lead">Creating a Redux instance is pretty simple.</p>
{% highlight php %}
<?php Redux::setArgs( 'OPT_NAME', array() );
{% endhighlight %}
    <p class="text">Remember the <code>opt_name</code> you selected? This is your unique key. To modify, add, or update anything related to Redux we use it. Oh, and did we mention you can use this same call over and over again to add options? The Redux API will auto-combine and override the argments you pass in.</p>
