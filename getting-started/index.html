        What's Included
    </h1>

    <p class="lead">Redux comes in two forms. The first is a plugin form, and the second is the full repo of which you only need a subset to run Redux. In both of these packages, <code>ReduxCore</code> is the only folder that matters, as the rest of the files just add additional features.</code></p>

    <h2 id="plugin-package">Redux Plugin</h2>
    <p>Once downloaded, unzip the compressed folder to see the structure of (the compiled) Redux Framework plugin. You'll see something like this:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
    redux-framework/
    ├── code-styles/
    ├── ReduxCore/
    ├── sample/
        ├── sample-config.php
        ├── barebones-config.php</code>
    </pre>
    <p>You'll notice the sample config is present here. You can activate the Redux sample-config file by activating the Redux plugin, and cliicking on the <strong>Activate Demo Mode</strong> on the plugins view within your WordPress admin.</p>
    <h2 id="repository-package">Repository or Composer</h2>
    <p>Once downloaded, you will find many more files than the plugin. It should look something like this:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
    redux-framework/
    ├── .tx/
    ├── bin/
    ├── code-styles/
    ├── ReduxCore/
    ├── sample/
        ├── sample-config.php
        ├── barebones-config.php</code>
    ├── tests/
    </pre>
    <p>Be warned that if you attempt to embed the entire Redux repo inside a theme or plugin it will not pass approval for many marketplaces including WordPress.org and ThemeForest.</p>

    <h1 id="concepts" class="page-header">
        Core Concepts
    </h1>
    <p class="lead">Redux is a single API making it simple to perform various options within the WordPress admin panel. We will go over a our basic concepts so you can properly grasp how Redux works.</p>

    <h3 id="argument_types">Arguments</h3>
    <p class="lead">Every object has arguments and every level of nested objects can inherit or override those arguments. When looking at an argument, make sure you're sure how it will affect all items below it (children).</p>
    <h3 id="global_arguments">Global Arguments</h3>
    <p class="lead">Global arguments are those arguments which affect every field or how this instance of Redux performs. These arguments can enable/disable the customizer by default, change the menu name, and set fields to automatically output CSS or not. For a more detailed breakdown, visit our <a href="">Global Arguments</a> page.</p>
    <h3 id="opt_name_key">opt_name, your unique key</h3>
    <p class="lead">One of the most important global variables is your <code>opt_name</code>. This is a unique key to distinguish your Redux instance from all others. It's also where your data is stored in the database and, if you are using the global variable, how you access data within your code.</p>
    <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-danger">
        <h4>Choose an uncommon <code>opt_name</code> to avoid issues</h4>
        <p>If two instances of Redux use the same <code>opt_name</code>, they will only override one another's settings in order of occurance. It is crucial that you pick a unqiue string for your product.</p>
    </div>
    <h3 id="never_modify_core">Never modify core files!</h3>
    <p class="lead">Redux is extremely extensible, which means you can override anything using filters. You will never find a need to modify a core file unless your helping us to solve a bug. <strong><u>NEVER</u> modify anything inside of ReduxCore</strong>. If you want to change how a field works, build an extension instead. Need to modify a value when it's saved? Use a filter.</p>
    <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
        <h4>Why is modifying ReduxCore files a bad practice when embedded in my own product?</h4>
        <p>Redux is built to run with only one instance of the framework. If you modify core files in your version, which you embed in a product, there's no garanteee that your version will be the version loaded should another product be using Redux. By using filters and extensions, you ensure that your code will always be loaded despite the "core" that is instantiated first.</p>

        Basic Config
    </h1>
    <p class="lead">Start with this basic config, or modify the <a href="https://github.com/reduxframework/redux-framework/blob/master/sample/barebones-config.php">barebones</a>, or the more extensive <a href="https://github.com/reduxframework/redux-framework/blob/master/sample/sample-config.php">sample config</a>, examples files.
