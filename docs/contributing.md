# Contribution Guide

Hello, and welcome to Redux!

Please read them thoroughly before submitting an issue on our issue tracker.

## If You are NOT the Developer

First, and most importantly, we need to know if you are a developer using Redux in their project, or if you are using a 
theme/plugin that uses Redux. **If you are not the primary developer**, please read out [Getting Support/Help](guides/basics/support-defined.md) guide.

## If You are the Primary Developer 

There are a number of things you can do to help us serve you better.

### 1. Update to the Latest Redux

**Please** check to see if you are using the latest version of Redux. If you plan to reporting an issue with any version BUT 
the latest version, we are going to ask you to upgrade to the latest code base anyway to see if your issue persists. 
Please save yourself and us some time by taking this simple step first. Thanks!

### 2. Generate a Support Hash

Before we will even look into your issue, we need a support hash. The reason is we have found around 80% of all our issues
are a configuration issue. By looking at the data sent in the support request, we can quickly identify concerns and save
you and us more time. Please read the [Generate a Support Hash](guides/basics/generating-a-support-hash.md) guide and 
have that URL handy.

### 3. Post to the Issue Tracker

We designed our issue tracker to help identify and correct issues within Redux. If you believe you have 
discovered an issue, or something is not working as it should, then submitting an issue is appropriate. However, if you 
are looking for a custom solution involving Redux, or require assistance with original code unrelated to the Redux core 
itself, then this type of support falls under [Premium support](https://redux.io/extensions/premium-support/). We have 
far too many people using Redux to provide training on PHP/JavaScript or to debug your code without compensation.

We handle all support for Redux Framework via our issue tracker. Email support is available only for those who have 
purchased Premium Support, or in instances where we have requested contact via e-mail.

It would also be hugely helpful to us if you are able to indicate any steps taken up until the issue occurred. We may 
need to be able to recreate your issue on our end, and having this information would help with that. Simply stating 
something 'doesn't work' isn't helpful, and tells us nothing. PLEASE, be as specific as possible.
