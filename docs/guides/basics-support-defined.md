# Getting Help: Our Support Defined
In order to help everyone understand what we will and will not support, this document has been created. Please read it
with understanding as we wish to truly convey our intent to help.

### Who are we?
We maintain an open source project entitled Redux Framework. It is used by millions of of users across the 
world, in all walks of life. Redux is used primarily by developers. That means if users of our developers 
approach us, it is often difficult and sometimes impossible to provide the requested support.

### Why is that?
Redux is built for developers. Without a basic understanding of PHP, error logs, and JavaScript bugs, it is impossible 
for us to provide solutions to those without the experience of coding in those spaces. We mean no disrespect, but it 
literally takes us 5 times longer to explain a standard developer concept to a non-developer.

### But I'm a user, does that mean I'm out of luck?!
Not entirely. We want to help, we really do. We simply need to be compensated for our time. Not only are we debugging a 
potential problem in OUR code, but also need to debug a problem within another developer's code to help. To do this, we 
need you to support our project by paying for premium support.

### But that's not fair!
It’s not fair that your developer has stopped supporting you, and we sympathize. However, we'll be required to find out 
exactly what your developer was doing, and that takes a LOT of time on our part. We need to charge for that service. 
Solving problems in third party applications that utilize Redux takes us away from our means as well as time spent 
making Redux better.

### Truly, we want to help!
Really, we want to help! But, at the end of the day we can't offer unlimited support for circumstances beyond our control.

### Best of Luck!
Truly, we wish you best of luck. We're not trying to insult. We will gladly solve problems in our code, but we cannot
solve problems in another's code without compensation.

### I still want support!
If you're still interested in support from us, you need to start by [generating a support hash](basics-generating-a-support-hash.md). 
Please do not be disappointed if we inform you that we will need you to purchase [premium support](https://redux.io/extensions/premium-support) 
for us to further assist you if your problem is outside of the scope of our framework.
