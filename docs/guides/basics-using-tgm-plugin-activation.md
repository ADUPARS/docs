# Using TGM Plugin Activation

The best way to use Redux is to use the TGM Plugin Activation class. This class allows you to encourage the user to
install Redux as a plugin, rather than embedding it in your theme or plugin. Why would you want to do that?

- The WordPress plugin is kept up to date with all new varnrabilities
- You don't have to worry about it
- We're rabbid about support
- It's a whole lot less pain during your code reviews

Honestly, the pain of embedding depending on the market (ThemeForest, WordPress.org) can be quite intense. As such, this
is the recommended approach by Redux.
